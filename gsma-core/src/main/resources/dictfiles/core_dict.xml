        It MUST NOT be used as a means of defining a completely separate
        vendor-specific Application Id space.

        This AVP MUST also be present as the first AVP in all experimental
        commands defined in the vendor-specific application.

        which MUST contain an example of an Auth-Application-Id AVP and an
        Acct-Application-Id AVP.

        The Failed-AVP AVP (AVP Code 279) is of type Grouped and provides

        fully processed due to erroneous information in a specific AVP.  The
        value of the Result-Code AVP will provide information on the reason
        for the Failed-AVP AVP.  A Diameter message SHOULD contain only one
        Failed-AVP that corresponds to the error indicated by the Result-Code
        AVP.  For practical purposes, this Failed-AVP would typically refer
        to the first AVP processing error that a Diameter node encounters.

        The possible reasons for this AVP are the presence of an improperly
        constructed AVP, an unsupported or unrecognized AVP, an invalid AVP
        value, the omission of a required AVP, the presence of an explicitly
        excluded AVP (see tables in Section 10), or the presence of two or
        more occurrences of an AVP which is restricted to 0, 1, or 0-1
        occurrences.

        A Diameter message SHOULD contain one Failed-AVP AVP, containing the
        entire AVP that could not be processed successfully.  If the failure
        reason is omission of a required AVP, an AVP with the missing AVP
        code, the missing vendor id, and a zero filled payload of the minimum
        required length for the omitted AVP will be added.  If the failure
        reason is an invalid AVP length where the reported length is less
        than the minimum AVP header length or greater than the reported
        message length, a copy of the offending AVP header and a zero filled
        payload of the minimum required length SHOULD be added.

        In the case where the offending AVP is embedded within a grouped AVP,
        the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP which in turn contains the
        single offending AVP.  The same method MAY be employed if the grouped
        AVP itself is embedded in yet another grouped AVP and so on.  In this
        case, the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP heirarchy up to the
        single offending AVP.  This enables the recipient to detect the
        location of the offending AVP when embedded in a group.

    <!-- Authorization-Lifetime -->
    
    <!--
        The Authorization-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code 291) is of type Unsigned32
        and contains the maximum number of seconds of service to be provided
        to the user before the user is to be re-authenticated and/or re-
        authorized.  Great care should be taken when the Authorization-
        Lifetime value is determined, since a low, non-zero, value could
        create significant Diameter traffic, which could congest both the
        network and the agents.

        A value of zero (0) means that immediate re-auth is necessary by the
        access device.  This is typically used in cases where multiple
        authentication methods are used, and a successful auth response with
        this AVP set to zero is used to signal that the next authentication
        method is to be immediately initiated.  The absence of this AVP, or a
        value of all ones (meaning all bits in the 32 bit field are set to
        one) means no re-auth is expected.

        If both this AVP and the Session-Timeout AVP are present in a
        message, the value of the latter MUST NOT be smaller than the
        Authorization-Lifetime AVP.

        An Authorization-Lifetime AVP MAY be present in re-authorization
        messages, and contains the number of seconds the user is authorized
        to receive service from the time the re-auth answer message is
        received by the access device.

        This AVP MAY be provided by the client as a hint of the maximum
        lifetime that it is willing to accept.  However, the server MAY
        return a value that is equal to, or smaller, than the one provided by

        The Origin-State-Id AVP (AVP Code 278), of type Unsigned32, is a

        Origin-State-Id MAY be included in any Diameter message, including
        CER.

        A Diameter entity issuing this AVP MUST create a higher value for
        this AVP each time its state is reset.  A Diameter entity MAY set
        Origin-State-Id to the time of startup, or it MAY use an incrementing
        counter retained in non-volatile memory across restarts.

        The Origin-State-Id, if present, MUST reflect the state of the entity
        indicated by Origin-Host.  If a proxy modifies Origin-Host, it MUST
        either remove Origin-State-Id or modify it appropriately as well.
        Typically, Origin-State-Id is used by an access device that always
        starts up with no active sessions; that is, any session active prior
        to restart will have been lost.  By including Origin-State-Id in a
        message, it allows other Diameter entities to infer that sessions
        associated with a lower Origin-State-Id are no longer active.  If an
        access device does not intend for such inferences to be made, it MUST
        either not include Origin-State-Id in any message, or set its value
        to 0.

    <!-- Acct-Interim-Interval -->
    
    <!--
        The Acct-Interim-Interval AVP (AVP Code 85) is of type Unsigned32 and
        is sent from the Diameter home authorization server to the Diameter
        client.  The client uses information in this AVP to decide how and
        when to produce accounting records.  With different values in this
        AVP, service sessions can result in one, two, or two+N accounting
        records, based on the needs of the home-organization.  The following
        accounting record production behavior is directed by the inclusion of
        this AVP:


        1.  The omission of the Acct-Interim-Interval AVP or its inclusion
        with Value field set to 0 means that EVENT_RECORD, START_RECORD,
        and STOP_RECORD are produced, as appropriate for the service.


        2.  The inclusion of the AVP with Value field set to a non-zero value
        means that INTERIM_RECORD records MUST be produced between the
        START_RECORD and STOP_RECORD records.  The Value field of this
        AVP is the nominal interval between these records in seconds.

        The Diameter node that originates the accounting information,
        known as the client, MUST produce the first INTERIM_RECORD record
        roughly at the time when this nominal interval has elapsed from
        the START_RECORD, the next one again as the interval has elapsed
        once more, and so on until the session ends and a STOP_RECORD
        record is produced.

        The client MUST ensure that the interim record production times
        are randomized so that large accounting message storms are not
        created either among records or around a common service start
        time.

        The Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP (AVP Code 483) is of type
        Enumerated and is sent from the Diameter home authorization server to
        the Diameter client or in the Accounting-Answer from the accounting
        server.  The client uses information in this AVP to decide what to do
        if the sending of accounting records to the accounting server has
        been temporarily prevented due to, for instance, a network problem.


        DELIVER_AND_GRANT 1

        The AVP with Value field set to DELIVER_AND_GRANT means that the
        service MUST only be granted as long as there is a connection to
        an accounting server.  Note that the set of alternative accounting
        servers are treated as one server in this sense.  Having to move
        the accounting record stream to a backup server is not a reason to
        discontinue the service to the user.


        GRANT_AND_STORE 2

        The AVP with Value field set to GRANT_AND_STORE means that service
        SHOULD be granted if there is a connection, or as long as records
        can still be stored as described in Section 9.4.

        This is the default behavior if the AVP isn't included in the
        reply from the authorization server.


        GRANT_AND_LOSE 3

        The AVP with Value field set to GRANT_AND_LOSE means that service
        SHOULD be granted even if the records can not be delivered or
        stored.
